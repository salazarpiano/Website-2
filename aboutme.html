    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>I am an aspiring young conductor, 
         pianist, and music educator based in Los Angeles, 
         California. In January 2018 I was awarded the very 
         first Conducting Fellowship at the Santa Clarita Valley 
         Youth Orchestra, and I now hold the position of Assistant 
         Conductor. At CalArts, I am an in-demand conductor, 
         who often leads student compositions, and student ensembles. 
         I am well versed in not only classical works, but also modern
         compositions. I was awarded a full scholarship to study at the 
         CalArts Piano department with Dr. Vicki Ray, and I have performed numerous 
         times as both solo pianist and chamber player.  I am proficient in 
         harpsichord continuo playing, and also have composed numerous works 
         for various ensemble types. In 2014 I was a finalist in the 
         Southern California Junior Bach Festival, where I received Regional 
         Honors. I started playing piano at 6 years old, and decided to 
         pursue music as a career at 14 years old. My life goal is to 
         become the conductor of a professional orchestra, and teach as a 
         professor of conducting and piano.
